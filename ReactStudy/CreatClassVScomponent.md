Two ways to do the same thing. Almost. React traditionally provided the `React.createClass` method to create component classes, and released a small syntax sugar update to allow for better use with ES6 modules by `extends React.Component`, which extends the `Component` class instead of calling `createClass`.

These differences are subtle in places, but have quite a few interesting differences worth exploring, which will allow you to make the best decision for which is best for you.

### Syntax differences

First, let's explore the syntax differences by looking at two code examples and annotating them.

##### React.createClass

Here we have a `const` with a React class assigned, with the important `render` function following on to complete a typical base component definition.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const Contacts = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
});
export default Contacts;
```

##### React.Component

Let's take the above `React.createClass` definition and convert it to use an ES6 class.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}
export default Contacts;
```

From a JavaScript perspective we're now using ES6 classes, typically this would be used with something like Babel to compile the ES6 to ES5 to work in other browsers. With this change, we introduce the `constructor`, where we need to call `super()` to pass the props to `React.Component`.

For the React changes, we now create a `class` called "Contacts" and `extend` from `React.Component` instead of accessing `React.createClass` directly, which uses less React boilerplate and more JavaScript. This is an important change to note further changes this syntax swap brings.

### propTypes and getDefaultProps

There are important changes in how we use and declare default props, their types and setting initial states, let's take a look.

##### React.createClass

In the `React.createClass` version, the `propTypes` property is an Object in which we can declare the type for each prop. The `getDefaultProps` property is a function that returns an Object to create initial props.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const Contacts = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {

  },
  getDefaultProps() {
    return {
      
    };
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
});
export default Contacts;
```

##### React.Component

This uses `propTypes` as a property on the actual `Contacts` class instead of a property as part of the `createClass` definition Object. I think it's nicer syntax to create class properties so it's much clearer what are React APIs versus your own on the definition Object.

The `getDefaultProps` has now changed to just an Object property on the class called  `defaultProps`, as it's no longer a "get" function, it's just an Object. I like this syntax as it avoids more React boilerplate, just plain JavaScript.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}
Contacts.propTypes = {
};
Contacts.defaultProps = {
};
export default Contacts;
```

### State differences

State is an interesting change, now we're using constructors the implementation of initial states changes.

##### React.createClass

We have a `getInitialState` function, which simply returns an Object of initial states.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const Contacts = React.createClass({
  getInitialState () {
    return {
    
    };
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
});
export default Contacts;
```

##### React.Component

The `getInitialState` function is deceased, and now we declare all state as a simple initialisation property in the `constructor`, which I think is much more JavaScript-like and less "API" driven.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {

    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div></div>
    );
  }
}
export default Contacts;
```

### "this" differences

Using `React.createClass` will automatically bind `this` values correctly for us, but changes when using ES6 classes affect this.

##### React.createClass

Note the `onClick` declaration with `this.handleClick` bound. When this method gets called React will apply the right execution context to `handleClick`.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const Contacts = React.createClass({
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this); // React Component instance
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick}></div>
    );
  }
});
export default Contacts;
```

##### React.Component

With ES6 classes this is slightly different, properties of the class do not automatically bind to the React class instance.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this); // null
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick}></div>
    );
  }
}
export default Contacts;
```

There are a few ways we could bind the right context, here's how we could bind inline:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this); // React Component instance
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}></div>
    );
  }
}
export default Contacts;
```

Alternatively we could change the context of `this.handleClick` inside the `constructor` to avoid inline repetition, which may be a better approach if moving to this syntax to avoid touching JSX at all:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
class Contacts extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this); // React Component instance
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick}></div>
    );
  }
}
export default Contacts;
```

### Mixins

React mixins are no longer supported when using React components written in ES6.

##### React.createClass

With `React.createClass` we can add mixins to components using a `mixins` property which takes an Array of available mixins. These then extend the component class.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
var SomeMixin = {
  doSomething() {

  }
};
const Contacts = React.createClass({
  mixins: [SomeMixin],
  handleClick() {
    this.doSomething(); // use mixin
  },
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick}></div>
    );
  }
});
export default Contacts;
```

##### React.Component

Mixins aren't supported in ES6 classes.

### Recommendations

Facebook does suggest the future removal of `React.createClass` completely in favour of ES6 classes. For now, use what makes sense, they're both just syntax with different semantics that do the same thing - they're both classes!
